                    <li>In 1991 Sir Tim Berners-Lee wrote a document called "HTML Tags" in which he proposed fewer than two  dozens elements that could be used for writing web pages</li>
                    <li>The first official specification was HTML 2.0 where by many of the features in this language were driven be existing implementations</li>
                    <li>The next revision after HTNL 4.0.1 was called XHTML 1.0</li>
                    <li>XHTML required following the rules of XML</li>
                    <li>All tags in XHTML were required to be lowercase</li>

            </header>
                <ul>
                    <li>Essentially HTML does not provide a huge number of elements to work with,this  has led to having other languages allow one to invent any element you want provided you teach the parser what those elements are</li>
                    <li>This is not fully restricted because HTML provides the class attribute that enables labeling of specific instances of an element. </li>
                    <li>There has been introduction of new inline elements which include mark,time,meter to markup measurements,progress to mark up a value that is in the process of changing</li>
                    <li>With HTML5 the structure has changed having introduction of new attributes.The attributes include :section used for grouping related related content,header for introductory or navigational aids,footer which has information about its containing elements,aside for tangentially related content,nav contain a navigation information </li>
                    <li>For better web page formatting its good to use some of the Content Models provided by HTML5,this include sectioning content</li>
