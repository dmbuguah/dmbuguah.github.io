    <h2>ID and Attribute Selector Specificity</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="color:green;">Its good to note that every inline declaration has a specificity of 1,0,0,0</li>
        <li>Universal selectors have a specificity of zero hence hence wins when applied to elements with other specificity.<br>This is a disasvantage of using universal selectors blindly</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Cascade</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If two rules apply to an element and one is marked !important,the one marked !important wins</li>
        <li>If two rules have exactly the same weight, origin, and
specificity, then the one that occurs later in the style sheet wins out.</li>
    </ul>
